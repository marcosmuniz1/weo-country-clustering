# Country Clustering with WEO Data

World Economic Forum Economic Outlook Analysis
## Overview

Welcome to the World Economic Forum Economic Outlook Analysis repository! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on macroeconomic data sourced from the World Economic Forum's economic outlook database. The primary objective of this analysis is to showcase how these machine learning techniques can be effectively utilized to group countries based on their economic indicators. This not only provides a deeper understanding of global economic patterns but also serves as a valuable tool for benchmarking and analyzing country performance across various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is derived from the World Economic Forum economic outlook database. It comprises a comprehensive set of macroeconomic indicators for multiple countries, offering a rich source of information for exploring economic trends on a global scale. These indicators may include but are not limited to GDP growth rates, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and other key economic variables.

## Methodology
### KMeans Clustering

The analysis employs KMeans clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group countries based on similarities in their economic indicators. KMeans is particularly effective in partitioning data into distinct clusters, enabling the identification of patterns and relationships among countries. By applying this algorithm, we aim to uncover hidden structures within the dataset and categorize countries according to shared economic characteristics.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

In addition to KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to decompose the variance in the dataset. PCA helps identify the most significant features that contribute to the variance observed in the data. By retaining only the most influential components, PCA facilitates a more concise representation of the economic landscape, making it easier to interpret and compare countries based on a reduced set of principal components.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this analysis is to provide a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to macroeconomic data. By grouping countries through KMeans clustering and reducing dimensionality with PCA, we offer a method for identifying similarities and differences in economic trends. This process is particularly useful for benchmarking, enabling researchers, policymakers, and analysts to assess and compare the economic performance of countries in various contexts.
